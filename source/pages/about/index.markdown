Overview
================================================================================

SEE-GRID CA is a Certification Authority managed and operated by the GRNET S.A., coordinator of the Greek National Grid Initiative, in cooperation with the Scientific Computing Center at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

Brief History
================================================================================

In the period between July 2004 and April 2010, SEE-GRID CA had been operating in the context of the SEE-GRID Regional Grid Infrastructure project series (SEE-GRID-I 2004-2006, SEE-GRID-II 2006-2008, SEE-GRID-SCI 2008-2010) with the mandate to provide catch all PKI services to the wider region of South Eastern Europe in order to facilitate the needs of distributed computing and pave the way for the countries in the region to establish their own national Public Key Infrastructure and guide them through the IGTF accreditation process.

Since May 2010, SEE-GRID CA provides Catch-All PKI services for the European Grid Initiative (EGI.eu) in the context of EGI-InSPiRe Project.

Trust Anchors
================================================================================

Trust Anchors (TAs) are cryptographic public keys used for digital signing of other public keys and some additional meta data associated with those public keys (e.g. X.509 digital certificates of Certification Authorities (CAs)) or other data

The CA certificate and CRLs are needed in order to correctly verify the validity of a certificate that has been issued by the SEE-GRID CA.

**Certificates**

* [SEE-GRID CA certificate in PEM format][cert-pem]
* [SEE-GRID CA certificate in DER format][cert-der]
* [Import the SEE-GRID CA root certificate in your browser][cert-import]

**Certificate Revocation Lists**

* [SEE-GRID CA CRL in PEM format][crl-pem]
* [SEE-GRID CA CRL in DER format][crl-der]

The procedures of identification and authentication of the certificate applicants are performed by trusted individuals (Registration Authorities), appointed by the SEE-GRID CA.
